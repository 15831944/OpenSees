Change log
-------------------------------------------------------------------
eliminated unnecessary warning message in EPPGapMaterial constructor (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
removed a minor bug in FSAM::betaf4() (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
removed a minor bug in SFI_MVLEM::setDomain() (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
removed a bug in joint2d constructor that prevented utization of database command (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
optimized PlainHandler::handle() for handling MP_Constraint objects (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
updated OPS_EqualDOF() and OPS_EqualDOF_Mixed() to set IsDiagonal fileld of constraint Matrix to 1 (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
added new field IsDiagonal to Matrix class to get rid of member-by-member check (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
added new ductility and maxDuctility options to material and Section objects respectively (SA Jalali, Oct. 14 2019)
updated previous energy recording modifications to respond correctly to database commands (SA Jalali, Oct. 14 2019)
added ResidNode, ResidDrift and ResidElement recorders (SA Jalali, Oct. 11 2019)
	These recorders are used for recording the residual response of structure at the end of an analysis. In lack of this ability,
	user needs to record the full history of response. This recorder is also useful for recording dissipated energy since it is a
	cumulutaive parameter and its value should be read at the end of analysis. Example for using this recorder option was added to
	"EXAMPLES/CSS-OpenSees Examples/ResidRecorderTest"

added internalForce ElementRecorder option ((SA Jalali, Oct. 12 2019)
	Currently implemented for elements: ElasticBeam2d/3d and ElasticTimoshenkoBeam3d. More elements will be included later.
	To use this option, enter "InternalForce $locRat" as argument to "recorder Element" or "recorder EnvelopeElement" commands
	where 0<$locaRat<1 denotes the section location. The outputs include 3 and 6 internal force components in 2-d and 3-d models,
	respectively. The order of forces follows local x->y->z axes and forces->moments.
	Example for using this recorder option was added to "EXAMPLES/CSS-OpenSees Examples/InternalForce Recorder" for 2-d and 3-d
	cases. Using this option is required for design-purpose utilization of OpenSees.
