-------------------------------------------------------------------
updating project settings to ignore browse information in debug mode (SA Jalali Oct. 28 2019)
	The changes in browse information caused re-build of the projects even if no changes were made.
updating Steel05 UniaxialMaterial for smooth desend (SA Jalali Oct. 28 2019)
	A smooth transition curve with the same R values as those used for the previous transition curve was added for the descending branch
	The tangent history curve is now continuous in all range of strains.
adding Steel05 UniaxialMaterial (SA Jalali Oct. 28 2019)
	a "Bilinear" version of Menegotto-Pinto Model that accounts for Cyclic and In-cycle deterioration modes
	The model best works when the transition curve uses a constant R value by omitting cR1 and cR2.
	To achieve this, use cR1=0 and cR2=0 values.
	In-cycle deterioration is accounted for by adding a descending branch with E=postCapEFac*E at eps=ductiliCapacity*Fy/E. This
	branch ends to a residual plateau at Sigma = resFac*Fy.
	The cyclic deterioration uses Rahnama-Krawinkler model that is based on hysteretic energies dissipated at positive and negative
	excursions to deteriorate positive and negative Fy's, respectively.
	
	Material Command:
	UniaxialMaterial Steel05 $matTag $Fy $E $b $ductilCapacity $postCapEFac $gama $c $resFac <$R0 $cR1 $cR2> <$a1 $a2 $a3 $a4> <$sigInit>

adding logCommands command (SA Jalali, Oct. 16 2019)
	reflects the OpenSees commands into a text file or/and the command window
	syntax: logCommands [-file $file ] [-echo] [-stop]
	$file: output text file name (.ops will be appended to file name) (defualt:commandsLog)
	-echo: starts echoing commands into command window
	-stop: stops command logging previously started by the command
	Note: the command can be successively issued 
removing getRecorder and geRecorderValue bugs (SA Jalali, Oct. 16 2019)
removing ShallowFoundationGn bugs (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
	accounted for the center node coordinates in generating soil nodes. (0,0) was used previously.
	the column base node was used instead of the newly generated node in definition of foundation
	beams; the related equalDOF command was also removed.
	
eliminated unnecessary warning message in EPPGapMaterial constructor (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
removed a minor bug in FSAM::betaf4() (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
removed a minor bug in SFI_MVLEM::setDomain() (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
removed a bug in joint2d constructor that prevented utization of database command (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
optimized PlainHandler::handle() for handling MP_Constraint objects (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
updated OPS_EqualDOF() and OPS_EqualDOF_Mixed() to set IsDiagonal fileld of constraint Matrix to 1 (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
added new field IsDiagonal to Matrix class to get rid of member-by-member check (SA Jalali, Oct. 15 2019)
added new ductility and maxDuctility options to material and Section objects respectively (SA Jalali, Oct. 14 2019)
updated previous energy recording modifications to respond correctly to database commands (SA Jalali, Oct. 14 2019)
added ResidNode, ResidDrift and ResidElement recorders (SA Jalali, Oct. 11 2019)
	These recorders are used for recording the residual response of structure at the end of an analysis. In lack of this ability,
	user needs to record the full history of response. This recorder is also useful for recording dissipated energy since it is a
	cumulutaive parameter and its value should be read at the end of analysis. Example for using this recorder option was added to
	"EXAMPLES/CSS-OpenSees Examples/ResidRecorderTest"

added internalForce ElementRecorder option ((SA Jalali, Oct. 12 2019)
	Currently implemented for elements: ElasticBeam2d/3d and ElasticTimoshenkoBeam3d. More elements will be included later.
	To use this option, enter "InternalForce $locRat" as argument to "recorder Element" or "recorder EnvelopeElement" commands
	where 0<$locaRat<1 denotes the section location. The outputs include 3 and 6 internal force components in 2-d and 3-d models,
	respectively. The order of forces follows local x->y->z axes and forces->moments.
	Example for using this recorder option was added to "EXAMPLES/CSS-OpenSees Examples/InternalForce Recorder" for 2-d and 3-d
	cases. Using this option is required for design-purpose utilization of OpenSees.
